"""
Create a function called append_size that has one parameter named my_list.

The function should append the size of my_list (inclusive) to the end of my_list. The function should then return this new list.

For example, if my_list was [23, 42, 108], the function should return [23, 42, 108, 3] because the size of my_list was originally 3.

"""
Write a function named append_sum that has one parameter — a list named named my_list.

The function should add the last two elements of my_list together and append the result to my_list. It should do this process three times and then return my_list.

For example, if my_list started as [1, 1, 2], the final result should be [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8].
